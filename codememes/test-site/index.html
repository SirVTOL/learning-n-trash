<p>Dolls:</p>
   <ul> 
    <li>Ten little Dolls went out to dine; One choked her little self and then there were nine.</li>
    <li>Nine little Dolls sat up very late; One overslept herself and then there were eight.</li>
    <li>Eight little Dolls travelling in Devon; One said she'd stay there and then there were seven.</li>
    <li>Seven little Dolls chopping up sticks; One chopped herself in halves and then there were six.</li>
    <li>Six little Dolls playing with a hive; A bumblebee stung one and then there were five.</li>
    <li>Five little Dolls going in for law; One got in Chancery and then there were four.</li>
    <li>Four little Dolls going out to sea; A red herring swallowed one and then there were three.</li>
    <li>Three little Dolls walking in the zoo; A big bear hugged one and then there were two.</li>
    <li>Two little Dolls sitting in the sun; One got frizzled up and then there was one.</li>
    <li>One little Doll left all alone; She went out and hanged herself <strong>and then there were none</strong>.</li>
   </ul>
